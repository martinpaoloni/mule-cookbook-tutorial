=== Adding @Processor Methods

. Remove the dummy operation the connector has.
+
. To add a processor simply type *proc* at the editor and use Ctrl+Space to display the templates and pick the simple processor.

+
. Change it to reflect the +getRecentlyAdded+ method signature, and there we have our first connector, ready to be tested.

. Run the http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Creating+an+Anypoint+Connector+Project#CreatinganAnypointConnectorProject-MoreDevKitActions[Generate Sources] Action.

See full link:{resourcesDir}/java/v1/CookbookConnector.java[Connector] source code.

At this point you can <<install-guide,install>> this Connector and try it in Studio if you want.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As you modify your connector, you may start seeing error markers on the generated folder.

Just ignore them.

Once you regenerate the sources, the errors will go away as the generated code will be refreshed.

==== Adding Samples to Your Connector

Let's now add the example for it.

Create the file pointed by the *{@sample ...}* if it doesn't exists already

*Note*: When you add an example, use the same name as the name that narrows the example in the file. Inside of it you have to put an example of the @Processor.

If you have the Javadoc check enabled, DevKit plugin marks the missing example as an error and provide a quick fix for us to easily add the example.

Otherwise, open the file and type *<* at the editor and use Ctrl+Space to display the templates and pick the one that best suite our operation.

Our example in this case looks like this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<!-- BEGIN_INCLUDE(cook-book:getRecentlyAdded) -->
	<cook-book:get-recently-added/>
<!-- END_INCLUDE(cook-book:getRecentlyAdded) -->
----

include::using-my-connector.adoc[]

// TODO IGNORE TESTING SECTION FOR NOW
// include::testing-processor.adoc[]
