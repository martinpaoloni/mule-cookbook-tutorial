== Adding DataSense

=== What is it?

DataSense improves the user experience at design time when creating Mule applications by enabling your connector to determine the API of your target resource.

Even though DataSense is optional, its use enables connector users to acquire metadata of the entities in a service.

See:

* http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Adding+DataSense[Adding DataSense]
* http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/DataSense[DataSense]

In this tutorial, we use a static DataSense model, which means that the entities are fixed and known upfront, and do not change. The fields that this model supports are also fixed.

=== Using DataSense

To use DataSense in the cookbook:

. Analyze the entities in {mule} service. We only have two simple entities, Recipe and Ingredient that both extend from CookBookEntity.
. Look at how our createIngredient operation looks inside Anypoint Studio, and how it interacts with other components.

==== Handling Ingredients

We defined the operation so that it receives an Ingredient, and it returns an Ingredient with the extra fields populated from the server.

Let's handle the ingredients:

. Check the input metadata to see that the expected output is a POJO, with the expected fields our Ingredient has:
+
image::datasense/datasense-expected-ingredients.png[width="800"]
+
. Verify that the output metadata is expected:
+
image::datasense/datasense-ingredients.png[width="800"]
+
. Drag and drop a {dataWeave} either behind or after our connector. The {dataWeave} automatically picks the input or output:
+
image::datasense/datasense-input.png[title="Transform Message Receiving Connector Output", width="800"]
+

Because DevKit auto-generates static metadata, DevKit automatically ensures that your connector knows how to propagate metadata information.

==== Handling Recipes

We don't have just Ingredients, we also have Recipes, so we don't want one method for each entity we have in our model.

Modify your connector to just work with the CookBookEntity class:

. Create an operation:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v4/CookbookConnector.java[lines=64..69]
----
+
. The *@RefOnly* annotation is used to tell DevKit that the input can only be specified as a reference (due to a DevKit limitations on handling Abstract classes).
+
Let's see how this affects the UI and user experience.
+
Studio, can no longer determine input or output type:
+
image::datasense/ref-only-input.png[title="Connector Input with @RefOnly",width="900"]
+
image::datasense/ref-only-output.png[title="Connector Output with Abstract Class",width="900"]

In the next section we get back our DataSense-friendly user experience.

The full source code of our connector with a create, update, get and delete operation is available link:{resourcesDir}/java/v4/CookbookConnector.java[here].

=== Implementing a MetaDataCategory

To implement DataSense using a @MetaDataCategory, you need to separate your implementation in two steps, retrieving the keys and describing the keys.

. Use the Anypoint DevKit Component wizard to create a new MetaDataCategory
+
image::datasense/new-metadatacategory.png[width="600"]
+
. Modify the method annotate with @MetaDataKeyRetriever to retrieve two keys, one for Recipe and another for Ingredient.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v5/DataSenseResolver.java[lines=28..37]
----
+
. Modify the method annotate with @MetaDataRetriever, to retrieve the description. Because we use a static model, we can just create a POJO model:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v5/DataSenseResolver.java[lines=48..65]
----
+
Check the full link:{resourcesDir}/java/v5/DataSenseResolver.java[source code].

To use this in our connector, modify our @Processors so that a user can pick the entities.

. Annotate our @Connector class with the @MetaDataScope annotation. This sets the default MetaDataCategory that's used every time users choose a @Processor that has a @MetaDataKeyParam.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v5/CookbookConnector.java[lines=35..37]
----
+
. To describe input and output, add a String annotated with *@MetaDataKeyParam*, and specify that it affects input and output by adding the *affects=MetaDataKeyParamAffectsType.BOTH* :
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v5/CookbookConnector.java[lines=69..75]
----
+
. In your get operation you need specify that the affect only applies to the output so we modify it just a little:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v5/CookbookConnector.java[lines=115..121]
----
+
. Check our new connector looks in Studio. We have a combo after we select the entity type and save it. This automatically refreshes our metadata.
+
image::datasense/datasense-static.png[width="800"]
+
Now even the {dataWeave} knows how to interact with our @Connector:
+

==== Dynamic DataSense

In the previous section we covered the scenario when your model is static. Let's take a look into a much more complex scenario.

There are APIs that provide a way to get entity definitions dynamically. Salesforce, NetSuite are just some examples of these.

In our case, our Cookbook provides an operation that describes our entities, so let's use that instead to get the entities and structure:

. Get the supported entities, and generate a key that we can use later:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v6/DataSenseResolver.java[lines=39..51]
----
+
. Use a structure that we can dynamically modify, and the way to do this in Mule is by using a +Map<String,Object>+ as parameters and/or return types of our connector.
+
Mule provides a builder that helps us generate the MetaData for the entities.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v6/DataSenseResolver.java[lines=60..87]
----
+
. Check the full link:{resourcesDir}/java/v6/DataSenseResolver.java[source code].
+
. In our @Connector now we need to add the code to generate the entities from the Map, and return Map in all our operations. Why is this important? To maintain consistency in our API.
+
This is how our new Create looks like:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v6/CookBookConnector.java[lines=73..88]
----
+
Note that now the UI is a different form before, because the input is now a map.
+
image::datasense/datasense-ui.png[width="900"]
+
. In our Mule app, we cannot update the metadata and use our connector. And, as you can see, note that we have a map structure instead of a POJO:
+
image::datasense/datasense-map.png[width="900"]
