=== Adding OAuthV2

The Server can also provide the token using OAuth 2.0, instead of doing a login request.

In order to use OAuth in you connector you just need to annotate your strategy with the @OAuth2 annotation.

If you only had the OAuth2 Configuration your Config would look like:

[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v9/OAuth2StandAloneConfig.java[]
----

All our operations now need to be marked with the @OAuthProtected, even our @Source.

In our Connector for example you will see:
[source,java]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v9/CookBookConnector.java[lines="113..129"]
----

Check link:{resourcesDir}/java/v9/CookBookConnector.java[full source] code.
