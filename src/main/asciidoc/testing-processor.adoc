=== Testing your @Processor

To test your @Processor:

. Generate the required files to test the operation, as if it was being used inside a Mule application.
. Right click the root of your project and click *Anypoint Connector* > *Generate Tests*.
. Select the operation you want to use to generate the test, and all the files you want to create.
. After the generation ends, modify the test to make the corresponding setup and assertions.

. Start the server, and run your test now.

It's all green!

So, what just happened?

* We ran a Mule app that contained one simple flow with the XML that represents our operation.
* A connector instance was created and using our configuration, connected to the server.
* The operation executed and the payload now is the result of that operation.
* We retrieved the payload, cast it to what we know the result is, and started making the relevant assertions.
