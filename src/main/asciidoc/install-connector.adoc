== Installing a Connector

=== Using the Anypoint DevKit plugin

Installing the connector is basically the same as installing any Eclipse plugin.

[[steps-to-install]]
To install your connector from the DevKit plugin:

. Right-click your project name in Package Explorer, and click *Anypoint Connector* > *Install Or Update*.

+
This triggers the DevKit Maven build tool, which generates an http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.pde.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fupdate_site.htm[update site] folder.
+
The files will be copied under the *dropins* folder located in the same directory as the AnypointStudio executable, and installed without the need of rebooting your AnypointStudio.
+
. You can now use your connector in a Mule app.

To uninstall the connectors you can either use the shortcut from the UI or remove the folder from the *dropins* directory and reboot your AnypointStudio

=== Installing from an UpdateSite

Connectors can be installed manually by selecting the update site generated by DevKit:

. Open a command prompt or terminal and change directory to where the pom.xml file is for your project (in the Eclipse workspace).
. Run *mvn clean package*.
. Click *Help* > *Install New Software...*.
+
