== Installing a Connector

Installing the connector is basically the same as installing any Eclipse plugin.

[[steps-to-install]]
To install your connector from the DevKit plugin:

. Right-click your project name in Package Explorer, and click *Anypoint Connector* > *Install Or Update*.

+
This triggers the DevKit Maven build tool, which generates an http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.pde.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fupdate_site.htm[update site] folder.
+
After the update site generates, a popup opens showing the task that is performed.

. Review the installation and update items, and accept the license agreement.
+
. Click *Finish* and restart Studio for the changes to be recognized.
+
NOTE: JAR files are not signed during this run, so you see a popup.

The same can be achieved by manually selection the update site:

. Open a command prompt or terminal and change directory to where the pom.xml file is for your project (in the Eclipse workspace).
. Run *mvn clean package*.
. Click *Help* > *Install New Software...*.
+

. Click *Add* and in the new dialog look for the folder.
. Click the UpdateSite file, generated under your project's target folder.
