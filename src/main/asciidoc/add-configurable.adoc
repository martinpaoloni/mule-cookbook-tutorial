. Type *conf* at the editor of your connector or your connection strategy and use Ctrl+Space to display the templates.

. Add a configurable field in our @Configuration component with a default value for the endpoint our client connects to so that users can connect to different sandboxes.
+
. Create the a setter and a getter, since all @Configurable items must have getters and setters.
