=== Adding Connection Management

Unlike the *getRecentlyAdded* call doesn't require authentication, all other operations require that you set a token on each request.

The client you are using provides a login call that initializes the token and uses it in subsequent requests.

[NOTE]
====
Take into account that the session can expire and cause the connector to make a login request again.
====

DevKit provides a different set of annotations to keep your code clean and handle the connection in a different class for delegating responsibilities.

To implement @ConnectionManagement, you need to move the initialization to @ConnectionManagement, instead of using the @Start annotation as we did before.

. In the ConnectorConfig change the @Configuration for a @ConnectionManagement annotation

. Add the MuleCookbookClient to the ConnectorConfig and add a getter and getter.

. Implement these four methods as shown in the code sample that follows:
+
* *@Connect* - Initialize the client, and if you don't have a login, call the API to verify.

* *@Disconnect* - Release any connection if required.

* *@ValidateConnection* - Check that your connection is alive.

* *@ConnectionIdentifier* - Return a string value. This will only be used when debugging.

. Remove the MuleCookBookClient from the CookbookConnector and the @Start method
+
. On our @Processor use the client provided by the ConnectorConfig

If you install this version and try to run the mule app we created before, you will see that it fails with a SAXParseException because we need to add a username and password to our configuration.

Just open the global configuration of your connector and check that there are 2 new fields, username and password. Configure them and you can run the app again.
